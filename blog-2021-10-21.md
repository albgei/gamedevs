## Welcome to gamedevs

### Week 3

We started our SRS and UCD. 
Both aren't quiet finished yet and will be overhauled in the upcomming weeks.

The UCD is a lot more conceptual than concrete but it should act as a decent foundation for the system structure.

Until December we will have implemented the Non-Static Entities and the NPC-Specific use cases.

Until June we will implement the Player-Specific use cases, the Static-Entity and Non-Entity.

The SRS is in a minimalistic state and will be expanded upon, as we implement those use cases.
Especially the order of implementation is something we are currently unsure of.
