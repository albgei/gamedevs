## Welcome to gamedevs

### Week 4

This week we made our first two use cases.

- [UC1](https://albgei.github.io/gamedevs/UCs/UC1_Player_Movement)
- [UC2](https://albgei.github.io/gamedevs/UCs/UC2_World_Interaction)

Since we don't have any visual assets yet for our game, we drew the mock-ups on paper.
We hope they don't look too unsettling and still deliver the message.
We also still have to find a way to test our use cases in Unity.
