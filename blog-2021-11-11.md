## Welcome to gamedevs

### Week 6

This week we set up YouTrack and started using Scrum for the first time.
None of us really had any experience with agile workflow so this is new ground for us.
Sadly this week our team had a lot of work to do and we weren't able to meet up together.
In the coming weeks we will add the missing tasks to YouTrack.
