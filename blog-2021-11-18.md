## Welcome to gamedevs

### Week 7

This week we had our retrospective.
It was nice to look back on the progress up until now.
Talking with another group was also really interresting as you notice the differences in the work approach.

We noticed one thing in particiular that our group was lacking: Meetings

Up until now our group only meet up when we had a lecture.
We all just did our part and it kind of worked out, surprisingly enough.
Compared to the other group however it did hamper any work and decisions that required the whole team.
We also only looked at each others work when we presented them so verification of work was basicly nonexistent.

For the future we will try to meet up more often.
Espacially as our code grows so will the bugs and complications that require the attention of all of us.

The retrospective definitely helped us finding this and a few other flaws.
We are hopefull that we will improve our situation and deliver a game befitting of our team work.
