### Week 8

This week we had made a class diagram.

Now instead of explaining why Unity is a special snowflake, our friendly neigbours over at Wizards vs. Robots wrote a great blog about Unity and it's style of composition over inheritance:

TL;DR: Unity doesn't really fall under the rules of OOP and avoids inheritance.
It handles most of its logic in seperated scripts that can be added to objects (therefore composition/ made from diffrent scripts).
