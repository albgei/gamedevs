## Welcome to gamedevs

### Week 2

We did some [Risk Management](https://albgei.github.io/gamedevs/blob/gh-pages/Risk%20Management).
Because excel files can't easily be insterted into github-pages, we did a normal table and used colored boxes to indicate the risk factor.
Our biggest risks right now are the lack of proper time tracking and our inaccurate specifications.
We have now assigned personel to each of the risks and will handle them appropriately.
