## Welcome to gamedevs

### Week 5

This week we did our Retrospective.

We reflected upon ourselfes after working on the project for a whole semester.

There were many things that didn't go as well as we wanted them to be.

There were however also some good things.

Overall we can say that we made decent progress and that the future of our project is certain.

We hope you look over us while we try our best.
