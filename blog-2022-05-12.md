## Welcome to gamedevs

### Week 5

This week we did some refactoring excercises.

Each team member had to do the excercise by themself:
- [Albert]()
- [Beraat]()
- [Danilo](https://github.com/tyron82/Fowler-c0e1c7a21a5335d7e475c2c795ed77deec37b776)

While there are certain shortcuts depending on the IDE to make refactoring easier, VIM is still the best way to edit textfiles while having a simple test makes sure to point out any mistakes that happen while refactoring.
