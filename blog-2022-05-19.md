## Welcome to gamedevs

### Week 7

This week we had to implement some Design-Patterns in our Code. The good thing was, that we already have some implemented by default, for unsing Unity.
Unity has different Design-Patterns already implemented wich as a user we canÂ´t change. Unity also works with the Visitor-Pattern to access scripts for different entities.

The downside is that implementing other Design-Patterns is hard. Because to implement one, for most, you need to have at least have multiple senders and/or recievers in diffrent classes. The problem lies in the fact that ~95% of the self written code in Unity are scripts, that should interact only with interfaces, that you have to define in the GUI of Unity. It is possible to implement them though, but here we come to our code wich has no Use-Case where we have enough functionality in one place to justify a Design-Pattern.
